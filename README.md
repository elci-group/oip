# oip
A Rust-based tool for rapid prototyping and iterative development, designed to streamline LLM-generated code workflows. Instead of manually copying and pasting outputs from your language model into project files, OIP can automatically overwrite files directly from your clipboard — intelligently, safely, and with language awareness.
